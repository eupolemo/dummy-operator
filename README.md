# dummy
This is a Kubernetes controller 

## Description
This dummy controller with a custom resource called dummy with a POD associated.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=docker.io/eupolemo/dummy:latest
```

**NOTE** You need permission to push the container. For purpose of run without 

2. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=docker.io/eupolemo/dummy:latest
```

3. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/dummy_v1alpha1_dummy.yaml
```

### Delete Resources:

```sh
kubectl delete -f config/samples/dummy_v1alpha1_dummy.yaml
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

3. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/dummy_v1alpha1_dummy.yaml
```

**NOTE:** The logs will show the status changing and the Dummy.Spec info

4. Describe the Custom Resource will show the state of the resource:

```sh
kubectl describe dummies.dummy.interview.com dummy-sample
```

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
